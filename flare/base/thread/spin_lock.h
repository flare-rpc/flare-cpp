//  Most users requiring mutual exclusion should use mutex.
//  spin_lock is provided for use in three situations:
//   - for use in code that mutex itself depends on
//   - to get a faster fast-path release under low contention (without an
//     atomic read-modify-write) In return, spin_lock has worse behaviour under
//     contention, which is why mutex is preferred in most situations.
//   - for async signal safety (see below)

// spin_lock is async signal safe.  If a spinlock is used within a signal
// handler, all code that acquires the lock must ensure that the signal cannot
// arrive while they are holding the lock.  Typically, this is done by blocking
// the signal.
